# Juice : A browser-based Compiler in Typescript

Juice your code into Machine Language!

Setup TypeScript
================

1. Install the [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) package manager if you don't already have it.
2. Run `npm install -g typescript` to get the TypeScript Compiler. (You may need to do this as root.)
3. When finished writing some awesome Typescript, type `tsc` to compile the Typescript to Javascript.


Workflow
=============

Some IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio, IntelliJ, others) natively support TypeScript-to-JavaScript compilation.
If your development environment does not then you'll need to automate the process with something like Gulp.
